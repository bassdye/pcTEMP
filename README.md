The following R script provides the steps to statistically analyze the compartmental usage of an organism 
within the water temperature preference chamber following methods in Aebischer et al. (1993) and Schram et al. (2013). 
This script is geared towards analyzing the data obtained from the Ethovision fish tracking software but 
can be adapted for manual counts (e.g., Schram et al. 2013; Dye et al. 2023).
